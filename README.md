# cv
This repository contains the source for my curriculum vitae. I provide this as publicly available in case anyone finds this template useful for their own CV or resume.

This was originally written in LaTeX, but I have since converted it to Markdown to allow easier integration with the Jekyll source for my personal academic website (http://brhillman.github.io). To compile the Markdown source into a pdf, you will need pandoc. Then, simply execute `pandoc -o cv.pdf cv.md`.

To compile the old LaTeX source (which is now most likely outdated), simply execute `pdflatex cv`.
