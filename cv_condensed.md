### Research interests
Dr. Hillman's research interests include the development, evaluation, and application of global atmosphere models, especially the representation of clouds and their interaction with radiant energy transfer in those models. Dr. Hillman is heavily involved in the development of the Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), including efforts to push the atmosphere component of the model to very high (cloud resolving) resolutions and preparing the model for next generation supercomputing architectures. Dr. Hillman obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Washington, where he worked under Dr. Thomas Ackerman and Dr. Roger Marchand on methods for evaluating clouds in global climate models using satellite instrument simulators to improve comparisons between models and satellite retrievals.
